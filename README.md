# Puppeteer

# Introduction

Puppeteer is a Node.js library for automating, testing and scraping web pages on top of the Chrome DevTools Protocol.

# What is Scraping and why it is needed ?

Web scraping is the process of automating data collection from the web. The process typically deploys a “crawler” that automatically surfs the web and scrapes data from selected pages. There are many reasons why you might want to scrape data. Primarily, it makes data collection much faster by eliminating the manual data-gathering process. Scraping is also a solution when data collection is desired or needed but the website does not provide an API.
